# RL_assignment_MiniHack

## Installation

Code for installing the required packages are already provided in the relevant Jupyter Notebook files. Otherwise, instructions for setting up MiniHack can be found here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/minihack. 

Google Colab was used to run all code, firstly so that packages can be installed in isolation, and for the extra computing resources.
